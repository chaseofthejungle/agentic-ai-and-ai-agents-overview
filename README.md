# Agentic AI and AI Agents Overview

**Description:** Although *AI Agents* and *Agentic AI* share similarities, there are key differences. For example, AI Agents are focused around tasks/processes, such as data access, support services, and teaching/tutoring, within specific domains while adhering to structured prompts. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is a philosophy/architecture: it is concentrated on how systems are to continuously and independently adapt/evolve, accomplish goals and orchestrate goal-oriented problem solving, and artificially 'reason' and reach decisions (even in dynamic settings in which questions are open-ended and complex).
