# Agentic AI and AI Agents Overview

**Description:** Although *AI Agents* and *Agentic AI* share similarities, there are key differences. For example, AI Agents are focused around tasks/processes, such as data access, support services, and teaching/tutoring, within specific domains while adhering to structured prompts. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is a philosophy/architecture: it is concentrated on how systems are to continuously and independently adapt/evolve, accomplish goals and orchestrate goal-oriented problem solving, and artificially 'reason' and reach decisions (even in dynamic settings in which questions are open-ended and complex).

## <a name="bottomline">3. The Bottom Line</a>
  
* *AI Agents* are task-oriented utilities, and lack the independence and flexibility that Agentic AIs have. They are intended for specific purposes, such as accessing data, providing tutoring on a topic, or supplying base-level customer support.

* *Agentic AIs* are more complex, autonomous, and architecturally sophisticated. 'Agentic AI', in and of itself, is an overarching principle or philosophy: AIs need to be able to process/'think', change, and behave with minimal external assistance. This limits reliance on prompts and predefined applicability/potential.
