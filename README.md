# Agentic AI and AI Agents Overview

**Description:** Although *AI Agents* and *Agentic AI* share similarities, there are key differences. For example, AI Agents are focused around tasks/processes, such as data access, support services, and teaching/tutoring, within specific domains while adhering to structured prompts. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is a philosophy/architecture: it is concentrated on how systems are to continuously and independently adapt/evolve, accomplish goals and orchestrate goal-oriented problem solving, and artificially 'reason' and reach decisions (even in dynamic settings in which questions are open-ended and complex).

## <a name="typesaiagents">1. Types: AI Agents</a>

AI agents are intended to serve specific domains, with clearly defined implementations. They are deployed as assistants or tools, and tend to be constructed from frameworks and/or toolchains.

| Technology | Use Cases | Features | Examples |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| **Chat Bots** | Task-Specific/Rule-Based Customer Support Automation | Consistent, Fast, Generative Responses | AI Support Bots on Various Websites |
| **Data Analysts** | Data Insights | Conversational, Domain-Based, Report Generating, Code Analyzing, Personal Tutoring | ChatGPT-integrated AI Analyst Bots |
| **Access Tools** | Accessing Data from Apps and APIs Based on Structured Workflows/Prompts | Provides Access to Scope of Services/Technologies | Model Context Protocol (MCP) Agents |
| **Virtual Assistants** | Performing Common/General Purpose Tasks and Services | Highly Portable Across Hardware/Software, Voice Recognition | Alexa, Grok, Siri, Meta AI |

## <a name="aaichars">2. Characteristics: Agentic AI</a>

Agentic AIs are architecturally designed to be autonomous, artificially environment-conscious systems that are intended for complex decision-making, including for adaptive goals/outcomes. They do not rely on structured prompts, performing dynamically and independently.

| Characteristic | Explanation | Examples |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Achievement-Oriented Focus | Accomplishes Goals Rather Than Simply Processing Tasks | Project Management and Research Agent AIs|
| Adaptability | Adjusts Behavior Based on Results | User/System Feedback-Oriented Bots |
| Independence | Behaves Autonomously Without Specific Instructions | Apps Embedded into Self-Contained Environments/Workflows |
| Logical Reasoning | Can Artificially Think, Develop Plans, and Execute Plans | Complex Process Execution and Problem Solving |

## <a name="bottomline">4. The Bottom Line</a>
  
* *AI Agents* are task-oriented utilities, and lack the independence and flexibility that Agentic AIs have. They are intended for specific purposes, such as accessing data, providing tutoring on a topic, or supplying base-level customer support.

* *Agentic AIs* are more complex, autonomous, and architecturally sophisticated. 'Agentic AI', in and of itself, is an overarching principle or philosophy: AIs need to be able to process/'think', change, and behave with minimal external assistance. This limits reliance on prompts and predefined applicability/potential.
