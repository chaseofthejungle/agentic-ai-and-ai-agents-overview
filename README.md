# Agentic AI and AI Agents Overview

**Description:** Although *AI Agents* and *Agentic AI* share similarities, there are key differences. For example, AI Agents are focused around tasks/processes, such as data access, support services, and teaching/tutoring, within specific domains while adhering to structured prompts. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is a philosophy/architecture: it is concentrated on how systems are to continuously and independently adapt/evolve, accomplish goals and orchestrate goal-oriented problem solving, and artificially 'reason' and reach decisions (even in dynamic settings in which questions are open-ended and complex).

## <a name="typesaiagents">1. Types: AI Agents</a>

AI agents are intended to serve specific domains, with clearly defined implementations. They are deployed as assistants or tools, and tend to be constructed from frameworks and/or toolchains.

| Technology | Use Cases | Features | Examples |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| **Chat Bots** | Task-Specific/Rule-Based Customer Support Automation | Consistent, Fast, Generative Responses | AI Support Bots on Various Websites |
| **Data Analysts** | Data Insights | Conversational, Domain-Based, Report Generating, Code Analyzing, Personal Tutoring | ChatGPT-integrated AI Analyst Bots |
| **Access Tools** | Accessing Data from Apps and APIs Based on Structured Workflows/Prompts | Provides Access to Scope of Services/Technologies | Model Context Protocol (MCP) Agents |
| **Virtual Assistants** | Performing Common/General Purpose Tasks and Services | Highly Portable Across Hardware/Software, Voice Recognition | Alexa, Grok, Siri, Meta AI |

## <a name="aaichars">3. Characteristics: Agentic AI</a>

Agentic AIs are architecturally designed to be autonomous, artificially environment-conscious systems that are intended for complex decision-making, including for adaptive goals/outcomes. They do not rely on structured prompts, performing dynamically and independently.

| Characteristic | Explanation | Examples |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Achievement-Oriented Focus | Accomplishes Goals Rather Than Simply Processing Tasks | Project Management and Research Agent AIs|
| Adaptability | Adjusts Behavior Based on Results | User/System Feedback-Oriented Bots |
| Independence | Behaves Autonomously Without Specific Instructions | Apps Embedded into Self-Contained Environments/Workflows |
| Logical Reasoning | Can Artificially Think, Develop Plans, and Execute Plans | Complex Process Execution and Problem Solving |

## <a name="aaiframework">4. Bottom-to-Top Framework: Agentic AI</a>

*On a base-level, Agentic AI:*

* **Develop Objectives**
  + Process objectives and task goals are constructed in response to user's guidelines.
* **Establish Understanding of Context** 
  + Store data on task purposes/user's intentions, process environment, and the state of the user session. 
* **Maintain Access to Previous Interactions**
  + Must be able to instantly pull this data during task processing.
* **Utilize Tools (e.g., API)**
  + Tool selection is based on the provided prompts/instructions.
* **Adhere to Predefined Instructions** 
  + Consult the provided prompts in logically processing tasks *(Note: Although prompts are very much relevant to Agentic AI, the autonomous processing and problem solving abilities of Agentic AI go well beyond simply responding to predefined structures)*.

*Then, they:*

* **Strategize Their Reasoning**
  + Condense processes using logical steps provided by programmed loops.
* **Utilize Long-Term Memory**
  + Provide additional context in assisting with problem solving.
* **Take Action Within Their Systems**
  + Evironmental events cause responses to be triggered, as task processing evolves.
* **Behave as if 'Meta'**
  + Analyze previous decisions and evolve to make more desirable decisions in response to future prompts.
* **Reorder Goals**
  + This is in response to new user data/requests.

*Finally, they:*

* **Independently Plan and Process**
  + This supplies problem solving potential beyond that of traditional AI Agents.
* **Coordinate with Other Systems**
  + Delegation and distrubtion of problem solving provides communications and artificial 'leadership' in problem solving. This step also occurs after the next step, especially in consultation with APIs and other live response systems.
* **Change Their Behavior**
  + This is adaptive and based on learning algorithms, providing the appearance of higher-level intelligence.
* **Autonomously Manage Themselves and Environmental Relationships**
  + Objectives, resources, and tools are considered without direct coordination from a person.

## <a name="bottomline">5. The Bottom Line</a>
  
* *AI Agents* are task-oriented utilities, and lack the independence and flexibility that Agentic AIs have. They are intended for specific purposes, such as accessing data, providing tutoring on a topic, or supplying base-level customer support.

* *Agentic AIs* are more complex, autonomous, and architecturally sophisticated. 'Agentic AI', in and of itself, is an overarching principle or philosophy: AIs need to be able to process/'think', change, and behave with minimal external assistance. This limits reliance on prompts and predefined applicability/potential.
